# Decisions waiting on a human

The standing queue of questions only Daniel can answer. **Kept current as work
happens**, so that a session can open by asking everything at once rather than
stopping halfway through to ask one thing.

Why this file exists: across four sessions, work has been blocked by decisions
far more often than by effort. Four open questions gated three sessions; they
were answered in a single message and unblocked a day of work. The bottleneck
is not how fast code gets written, it is how long a question sits.

## How this is used

- **Anything here blocks something.** If a question stops mattering, delete it
  rather than leaving it to be re-read.
- **Before a long session, everything here is asked in one batch.** Not one at
  a time as each is reached.
- **An answer goes into the ADR or the doc it belongs in immediately**, and
  the row is deleted. This file is a queue, not a record — `DECISIONS.md` is
  the record.
- A question that turns out to have an obvious default is not a question. Pick
  the default, say so, and move on.

## Open

| # | Question | Blocks | Why it cannot be defaulted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | **What may leave the machine?** Which providers, if any, are acceptable destinations for document content or embeddings. | Phases 8 and 10; `Network::Allowed` currently means only "this profile does not forbid it" | Baking in a provider list would be an answer nobody gave, about data leaving the user's computer |
| D2 | **Is `--editor-view`'s two-view fork worth keeping indefinitely?** IME cannot work on Slint 1.17.1, so parity is unreachable until Slint changes. | Every future wiring item pays a small tax; five features work in only one view | Answered once already (keep opt-in). Re-ask only if the tax becomes visible, or Slint ships composition support |
| D3 | **May `bp-storage` be wired into the application?** ADR-0020 permits `Metadata::Summary` under Standard, so the security half is settled. What remains is a product decision plus a design pass. | Phase 9, `bp-organize` | ADR-0019 explicitly says not to "just wire it up" |

## Answered, for context

Kept briefly so a later session does not re-ask. Full reasoning lives in the
ADRs.

| Question | Answer | Where it landed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom cryptography — compose or implement? | Compose vetted primitives; never implement them | ADR-0011, clarified |
| `.bpadx` AEAD | Both XChaCha20-Poly1305 and AES-256-GCM, versioned in the envelope | ADR-0021 |
| `.bpadx` envelope shape | Chunked from the start, chunk index bound into the AAD | ADR-0021 |
| Argon2id cost | OWASP baseline (19 MiB, t=2, p=1), recorded per document | ADR-0021 |
| Platform key protection (DPAPI/Hello/keyring) | Phase 16, not 15 | ADR-0021 |
| Security profiles | All of them; profile model first | ADR-0020 |
| YAML parser | `saphyr` | Phase 6, when it is taken |
| Parity vs retiring the custom editor view | Keep it opt-in, revisit on a Slint upgrade | ROADMAP, WORK_QUEUE |
